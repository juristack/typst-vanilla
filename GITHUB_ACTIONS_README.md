# GitHub Actions Setup Complete

The GitHub Actions for the Vanilla Typst package have been set up successfully. Here's what was created:

1. **GitHub Action Workflows**:
   - `.github/workflows/typst-publish.yml` - Creates a PR to typst/packages when a tag is pushed
   - `.github/workflows/validate.yml` - Validates the package on every push and PR

2. **Documentation**:
   - `RELEASE.md` - Detailed release process guide
   - `GITHUB_ACTION.md` - Quick reference for GitHub Actions
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - Track changes between versions

3. **Validation Script**:
   - `validate-package.sh` - Checks that your package meets all requirements

## Next Steps

To create your first release:

1. Make sure the version in `typst.toml` is correct (currently 0.1.0)
2. Run the validation script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/validate-package.sh
   ```
3. If validation passes, create and push a tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```
4. The GitHub Action will automatically create a PR to the typst/packages repository

## Important Notes

- The GitHub Action uses the `peter-evans/create-pull-request` action which requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions
- For full functionality, make sure your repository has proper permissions configured
- The workflow uses your `justfile` to package the files before submission

For more details, see:
- [RELEASE.md](../RELEASE.md) - Full release process
- [GITHUB_ACTION.md](GITHUB_ACTION.md) - Quick GitHub Actions reference
